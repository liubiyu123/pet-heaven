    "hdb": "HDB Approved",
    "content": "Marco is an incredibly friendly boy who may jump on you the first time he meets you since he's so excited. He still has a lot of puppy energy and can sometimes be rough when he plays. He listens to commands well and generally walks well but would need an experienced handler to manage his puppy enthusiasm. We would strongly recommend that the adopter engages a professional trainer for Marco and work consistently to keep his exuberant behaviour in check."

    "content": "Milo is a lovable and obedient boy. With people he is familiar with, he will approach with a waggy tail but he is wary of unfamiliar faces and will need time to warm up."

    "bday": "2 yrs 2 mths",
    "hdb": "HDB Approved",
    "content": "When Sakae was first rescued, he was extremely timid and would shy away from human contact. Now, whilst still shy with strangers, Sakae has transformed into an affectionate, curious boy who will display his playful side once he warms up. His comical and quizzical expressions add to his charm. If yours is a family with adults or teenagers, with the patience to allow him time to settle in, Sakae will be a fun addition to your family."
