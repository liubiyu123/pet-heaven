# Stray Animal Welfare - ReactJS Project

## Project Overview

This project is an initiative aimed at promoting animal welfare, particularly focusing on stray dogs and cats in Singapore. Despite slight progress in recent years, the culling of stray dogs continues due to rapid urbanization. This project serves as a platform for volunteers, stray lovers, feeders, and rescuers who are working together to bring about change for these innocent animals.

## What We Do

The core mission of this platform is to raise awareness, organize rescue operations, provide information, and create a community for animal welfare activists. We believe in offering solutions that benefit both animals and the community, all while advocating for a more humane approach to handling strays.

### Features

- **Adopt/Rescue Options**: Learn how to rescue and adopt stray animals in Singapore.
